#  Automated Inbox Manager

**Automated Inbox Manager** is a lightweight machine learning-based application that classifies emails as either **Important** or **Not Important**, helping users prioritize their inbox more efficiently.

It uses a trained `RandomForestClassifier` on TF-IDF features extracted from email subject and body text. The UI is built with **Gradio**, offering an easy and intuitive web interface to interact with the model.

##  Objective

> To simplify email management using machine learning by automatically identifying and highlighting important emails.

##  How It Works

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - A labeled dataset `generated_email_dataset.csv` is used, which contains:
     - `subject` â€“ the email subject line
     - `body` â€“ the content of the email
     - `label` â€“ binary classification label (1 = Important, 0 = Not Important)

2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - The `subject` and `body` are concatenated into a single text field.
   - A TF-IDF vectorizer transforms the combined text into numerical features.

3. **Model Training**:
   - A `RandomForestClassifier` is trained on the vectorized email texts to predict importance.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The model predicts if a new email is important based on the subject and body entered in the UI.

##  User Interface (Gradio)

### Fields:
- **Email Subject** â€“ Text input for the subject line.
- **Email Body** â€“ Multiline input for the body of the email.
- **Classification Result** â€“ Shows the prediction:
  - âœ… Important â€“ Open
  - ðŸš« Not Important â€“ Ignore
